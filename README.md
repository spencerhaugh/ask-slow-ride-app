# Realtime Twitter API App

## Custom Twitter Application For The Slow Ride Podcast:

This application utilizes the Twitter API to search for and return any tweet containing the hashtag #askslowride, and displays them on a SPA. App will eventually be deployed online via Heroku.

This application uses socket.io to pass information that the Node/Express backend server recieves from Twitter to the front end. It is currently completely functional, but it not deployed to a live site.
